Hi there, thanks for checking out my project!

Welcome to the Personal Finance Manager (PFM). In this java-based and SQL backed application, users are able to log in or create an account. Once they have an account and log in, users are able to make transactions, update/delete transaction, view specific transactions, and calculate a total balance. 

This project was started as a personal project to build skills in both programming-logic and SQL, and it proved to be successful in both. The PFM is nowhere near its final product and will eventually be transitioned towards a GUI and complete user experience through JavaFX.
